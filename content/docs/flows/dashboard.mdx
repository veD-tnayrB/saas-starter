## Step-by-Step Flow

### Dashboard Access

1. User navigates to protected route
2. `(protected)/layout.tsx` checks authentication
3. `getCurrentUser()` validates session
4. If unauthenticated, redirect to `/login`
5. If authenticated, render dashboard content
6. User role determines available features

### Main Dashboard

1. Dashboard page loads with user data
2. User role displayed in header
3. Empty placeholder shown (no content created yet)
4. "Add Content" button for future functionality
5. Role-based navigation menu available

### Billing Dashboard

1. User subscription plan fetched via `getUserSubscriptionPlan`
2. Billing information displayed with current plan
3. Upgrade/downgrade options based on current tier
4. Stripe test environment warning shown
5. Billing portal access for existing customers

### Settings Management

1. User profile information displayed
2. Name and role update forms available
3. Account deletion option (with confirmation)
4. Settings persisted via server actions

### Admin Panel (ADMIN role only)

1. Role validation ensures ADMIN access only
2. Admin-specific dashboard with metrics
3. User management capabilities
4. Transaction and order management
5. System-wide analytics and controls

### Charts Dashboard

1. Demo charts using shadcn-ui components
2. Various chart types (area, bar, line, radial)
3. Interactive data visualization examples
4. Responsive grid layout for different screen sizes
