refactor: break down large components into smaller, focused modules

This commit implements a major refactoring to enforce component size limits
and improve code maintainability by breaking down large components into smaller,
reusable pieces following the "one component per file" principle.

Component Refactoring:
- Dashboard Components:
  * Split project-switcher.tsx into focused subcomponents:
    - project-switcher-button.tsx: Button component with project display
    - project-switcher-empty.tsx: Empty state handling
    - project-switcher-placeholder.tsx: Loading state placeholder
    - project-list.tsx: List container for projects
    - project-item.tsx: Individual project item component
    - create-project-dialog.tsx: Project creation dialog
  * Split project-members.tsx into:
    - members-list.tsx: List container for members
    - member-item.tsx: Individual member display component
  * Added use-create-project.ts hook for project creation logic
  * Added use-projects.ts hook for project data fetching with color generation

- Layout Components:
  * Split dashboard-sidebar.tsx into modular navigation components:
    - navigation-sections.tsx: Container for navigation sections
    - navigation-section.tsx: Individual navigation section
    - navigation-item.tsx: Individual navigation item
  * Added mobile navigation components:
    - mobile-sheet-sidebar.tsx: Mobile sheet sidebar implementation
    - mobile-navigation-sections.tsx: Mobile navigation container
    - mobile-navigation-section.tsx: Mobile navigation section
    - mobile-navigation-item.tsx: Mobile navigation item
  * Updated protected layout to use new modular components

- Pricing Components:
  * Split pricing-cards.tsx into:
    - pricing-card.tsx: Individual pricing card component
    - benefit-item.tsx: Benefit list item component
    - limitation-item.tsx: Limitation list item component

Infrastructure Changes:
- Migrated middleware.ts to proxy.ts using next-auth/middleware
- Updated protected layout to integrate new component structure
- Enhanced dashboard sidebar with collapsible functionality and localStorage persistence

Code Quality Improvements:
- Updated .cursor/rules/next-js.mdc with strict component guidelines:
  * Enforced maximum 80-line component limit
  * Mandated one component per file rule
  * Added interface naming convention (I prefix for interfaces)
- All new components follow TypeScript interface naming with "I" prefix
- Improved component reusability and testability

Breaking Changes:
- middleware.ts has been removed and replaced with proxy.ts
- Component file structure has been reorganized for better maintainability

Files Changed:
- 7 files modified (139 insertions, 743 deletions)
- 20 new component files created
- 1 middleware file deleted and replaced

This refactoring significantly improves code maintainability, reduces component
complexity, and makes the codebase more aligned with React best practices.
