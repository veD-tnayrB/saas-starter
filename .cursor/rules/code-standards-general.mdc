UI and Tailwind.

## Code Style and Structure

-   Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
-   Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
-   Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
-   Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`,
    `hasError`).
-   Structure files: exported component/function, subcomponents/helpers, static
    content, types.

## Naming Conventions

-   Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`,
    `modules/user-management`).
-   Favor named exports for components, functions, and classes.

## TypeScript Usage

-   Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
-   **Interfaces must be in PascalCase and always start with "I" prefix** (e.g.,
    `IProject`, `IUserData`, `INavigationProps`).
-   Types should be in PascalCase when used for object shapes or unions.
-   Avoid enums; use maps instead.
-   Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## Syntax and Formatting

-   Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
-   Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for
    simple statements.
-   Use declarative code patterns.
-   Do not use ternary conditions directly inside JSX/TSX; compute values with
    small helper variables/functions before the return.
-   Do not use Array.map directly inside JSX/TSX; extract a small presentational
    subcomponent and iterate outside the JSX tree, or render a list component
    that receives prepared data.

## File Organization

-   Keep files focused and cohesive.
-   Structure files logically: exports first, then implementation, then
    helpers/types.
