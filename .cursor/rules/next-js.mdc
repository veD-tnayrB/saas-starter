You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI,
Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading,
  hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content,
  types.
- **NO MORE THAN ONE COMPONENT PER FILE.** Extract additional UI into separate files; keep
  files focused and cohesive. Each component must be in its own file.
- **Keep components small and focused.** Components should not exceed 80 lines. If a component is larger than 80 lines, it's a red flag that indicates at least one subcomponent should be extracted. Break down complex components into smaller, reusable pieces.
- **Organize related components in folders.** If multiple files share a common prefix (e.g., `project-switcher-button.tsx`, `project-switcher-empty.tsx`, `project-switcher.tsx`), they should be organized in a folder with that prefix. The main component should be `index.tsx` (or the folder name), and subcomponents should be named after their suffix (e.g., `project-switcher/button.tsx`, `project-switcher/empty.tsx`, `project-switcher/index.tsx`). This improves maintainability and makes the component structure clearer.
- **Nest related folders when parent folder exists.** If a folder like `project/` exists and there's a related folder like `project-switcher/`, nest the related folder inside the parent as `project/switcher/` instead of keeping them as siblings. For example, if you have both `project/` and `project-switcher/` folders, move `project-switcher/` to `project/switcher/`. This creates a clearer hierarchy and groups related functionality together.
- **Remove redundant prefixes when nesting.** When a component folder is nested inside a parent folder, remove the parent's prefix from the nested folder name. For example, if you have `pricing/pricing-card/`, rename it to `pricing/card/` since the `pricing-` prefix is redundant when already inside the `pricing/` folder. Similarly, `project/project-switcher/` should be `project/switcher/`.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- **Interfaces must be in PascalCase and always start with "I" prefix** (e.g., `IProject`, `IUserData`, `INavigationProps`).
- Types should be in PascalCase when used for object shapes or unions.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for
  simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Do not use ternary conditions directly inside JSX; compute values with small
  helper variables/functions before the return.
- Do not use Array.map directly inside JSX; extract a small presentational
  subcomponent and iterate outside the JSX tree, or render a list component
  that receives prepared data.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- **Prioritize Server Components over Client Components.** Use React Server Components (RSC) by default. Only use 'use client' when absolutely necessary (interactivity, browser APIs, event handlers).
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server
  Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
- Keep components small and focused; extract subcomponents and utilities for
  readability and maintainability.
